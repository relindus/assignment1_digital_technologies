 <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<h3>Introduction </h3>

<p>In today’s globalised world, technology permeates nearly every aspect of daily life — from waking up to the sound of a digital alarm to checking a smartphone before going to sleep. It is striking to think about the time when digital technologies were not present to the extent that they
 are now in higher education. When I started my academic career in the humanities in 2019, no one talked about artificial intelligence, let alone the usage of ChatGPT, since it did not exist yet. 
 We were expected to borrow the materials from the library or buy the books that were included in the syllabus. Bringing a personal computer to university was rarely necessary at that time. 
 The only online library database I used was JSTOR, which now seems only a “last resort” page I look at in case I cannot find a text. My first year at university was when I learned how to write a proper academic text with proper citation on a computer.
  We were still expected to print out our papers or having to make notes from a three-hundred-page book to be eligible to take an exam. In addition, exams were all in person and had to be done on paper. 
  To think that only six years ago, that was the reality of my higher education and what the reality is now is unusual, but I would also not be able to imagine taking notes in notebooks and going to the library in person just to access material included in the syllabus now. 
 </p>
  <p>Current digital technologies in Intercultural Studies and English
  I am currently pursuing a degree in Intercultural Studies,
 a relatively recent and interdisciplinary field of research.
 Before that, I studied English and American Studies and during my 
 Intercultural Studies degree, I am on the English track. 
The current digital technologies that I have personally 
used are library databases, artificial intelligence at times,
 and Microsoft tools such as Word or PowerPoint. 
Although I have not yet used it for my own research,
 tools such as Voyant are increasingly employed within the field,
 particularly in linguistic and textual analysis, especially in language studies.
 </p>
 <p>I had an applied linguistics course during
 my English studies where we learned about corpus
 linguistics, which “…uses large collections of both 
spoken and written natural texts (corpora or corpuses, singular corpus)
 that are stored on computers.”(Schmitt & Rodgers, 2020)
 Through the use of various computer-assisted tools, corpus linguists are able to investigate a wide range of questions related to how language is 
used.(ibid.) During this course, we used a tool similar
 to the Voyant Tool to analyse song lyrics as part of an assignment.
 Looking at the text of a specific song, we could make
 assumptions about the composer of the song based on the repeated words, etc.
</p>
<p>This semester, we have a class called
 Intercultural Projects in a Transnational World, 
where we have to conduct our own research and create our own empirical
 materials. I have decided to do online
 interviews where I record the conversation and 
then find a tool to transcribe it for me as best
 as it can, and then I will correct the mistakes.
 I conducted the interview on Microsoft Teams, 
which will be my preferred way of doing online interviews,
 since the university is providing access to it.
</p>
<p>In the humanities, technology serves a particularly
 valuable role in facilitating research activities such as
 accessing library databases, conducting online interviews,
 transcribing speech, and analysing textual data. 
The immense benefit that technology gives to the humanities is
 that now we can access millions of written sources online, 
which saves a lot of time in terms of the habit of going to a 
library and browsing for sources for hours and reading every 
single paper, book, and publication that could be useful for
 our research.
 Now one finds material easier with the help of online library
 databases, and even in the sources found, if one is not
 sure where to start reading, they can easily just look up
 the topic by using the CTRL F shortcut. It saves time for 
the researcher, but without a doubt, it has its disadvantages,
 in my opinion. If one relies solely on online sources, it might
 be difficult one to distinguish credible sources. Moreover, 
the convenience of online searches may sometimes discourage 
deeper engagement with texts, as researchers can be tempted to 
skim or rely on keyword searches instead of reading thoroughly.
</p>
<h3>Introducing new technologies</h3>
<p>
I think the most disruptive technology being introduced in my field is
 artificial intelligence. While it has its positive features, it does
 more harm than help in my opinion.  It makes people less cautious with
 credible information (as mentioned in the previous chapter as well), 
and in general, it could make people put less effort into projects they
 could easily do, but they assume artificial intelligence will help 
make their project better and easier to create. 
Thinking back to the COVID-19 lockdown times, online teaching was
 also quite disruptive for some (although it is not solely my field 
that was affected by it, of course). Many of my courses had to 
change the exam requirements since we were not physically able to 
access books from the libraries that we were required to read, 
and most professors relied on the students’ library access, 
thus could not provide us with an online version of said material. 
</p>
<p>Introducing students to platforms such as Zoom, Teams, Moodle,
 or Canvas was one issue to deal with, but most professors had
 a hard time creating material in the mentioned platforms or
 holding classes. Online classes were also less effective
 since students could easily get distracted in their own environments.
</p>
<h4>Vital digital technologies for academics in humanities</h4>
<p>As the whole world is connected through social media platforms,
 one could assume that more often than not, digital technology 
creates the space for intercultural communication, which is an 
important element of the field of intercultural studies. It can
 also create interest and motivation in one, to later pursue a career
 in the field. To be able to thrive in Intercultural Studies, it is
 vital to be able to use the basic tools used for writing text, 
such as Word or Google Docs, for example. I would say using a
 PowerPoint-type platform is also useful, since presenting and 
pitching ideas is part of our academic journeys. To be able to
 conduct truly intercultural research in the field, it is definitely 
useful to be able to virtually be connected to the world, 
since the research data can be as thorough as the researcher
 wants it to be.  On the other hand, since the field is dealing
 with the humanities more specifically, cross-cultural 
experiences, I would say technically one could be successful
 in the field without digital technologies as well.
</p>
<p>In addition as a student, it is vital to be aware of the platforms 
provided through our institution, such as in our case, Mitstudie,
 Brightspace, Wiseflow, and STADS. Without these platforms, 
one would not be able to access the materials provided to help 
us learn and grow in our field as a student. If one would not 
be able to use these digital platforms mentioned they would fail
 to follow the course materials and later would not be able to 
participate in the exams either. The increasing dependence of 
students on digital technologies throughout their academic 
careers raises concerns about overreliance and the potential
 loss of traditional research skills.
</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>
    In conclusion, digital technologies have become very important in academic
 life in the humanities as well. 
Their integration has reshaped how research is conducted,
 and how knowledge is shared. The accessibility of online
 databases, transcription tools, and communication platforms 
has made research faster and more collaborative, offering 
unprecedented opportunities for intercultural exchange and
 digital literacy. At the same time, this dependence on technology
 introduces challenges, such as the risk of superficial engagement 
with sources, unequal access to digital tools, and an overreliance 
on artificial intelligence. Therefore, while digitalisation has
 brought immense efficiency and inclusivity to the humanities, 
it is essential for scholars to maintain a critical approach — one
 that balances technological convenience with the reflective, 
analytical depth that defines the field. Ultimately, technology 
should be seen not as a replacement for traditional academic 
practices but as a complementary tool that, when used thoughtfully,
 can enhance and expand the possibilities of humanistic inquiry.
